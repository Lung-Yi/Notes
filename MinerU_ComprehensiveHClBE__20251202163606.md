# Introduction

# 1.1 Comprehensive database of the BDEs

Chemistry and biochemistry are based upon the concept of chemical bonds. Because most chemical reactions involve the breaking and making of chemical bonds, chemists, biochemists, and chemical engineers need a complete database of the experimental data of bond dissociation energies (BDEs).

This book collects, classifies, reorganizes, assembles, compares, and recommends the experimental BDE data of more than 19,600 bonds of 102 elements from over 5,500 publications. It is the most comprehensive book on the BDE data in all various reactants:

biatomic molecules; polyatomic molecules; organic compounds;

inorganic compound; organometallics; biochemicals;

radicals; ions; clusters;

supramolecules; hydrogen-bonded species; surface-bonded species;

van der Waals complexes; the isotopic species.

These detailed arrangements can help end-users performing a quick search for experimental BDE data.

# 1.2 What is the BDE?

The homolytic BDE is defined as the enthalpy change in the following fission:

$$
R - X \rightarrow R + X. \tag {1.1}
$$

The BDE,  $DH^{0}(\mathbf{R} - \mathbf{X})$ , of a  $\mathbf{R} - \mathbf{X}$  bond is derived in the usual way from the heats of formation of the species involved in the above reaction:

$$
D H ^ {0} (\mathrm {R} - \mathrm {X}) = \Delta_ {\mathrm {f}} H ^ {0} (\mathrm {R}) + \Delta_ {\mathrm {f}} H ^ {0} (\mathrm {X}) - \Delta_ {\mathrm {f}} H ^ {0} (\mathrm {R X}). \tag {1.2}
$$

In this case,  $\Delta_{\mathrm{f}}H^{0}$  represents the heats of formation of the respective species in the ideal gas state at standard pressure and at a reference temperature of  $298.15\mathrm{K}$ .

Therefore, the BDE is also called the bond dissociation enthalpy. Here, species RX represent molecules, radicals, ions, and complexes, as well as clusters. The BDEs are commonly referred to as bond energies, bond strengths, binding energies, or bond disruption energies (enthalpies). The BE or D are other simplified abbreviation of the BDE in the literature.

The terms bond strength or binding energy are also widely used in scientific literature. For example, bond strength is frequently used to describe dentins, glasses, ceramics, resins, adhesives, and coatings; whereas, binding energy is used to describe selected electronic levels in atoms. Clearly, the binding energy or bond strength in these cases is not equivalent to the bond dissociation energy (enthalpy) in this volume.

In this volume, varied processes of the bond dissociation are included, such as:

<table><tr><td>Bond Dissociation Processes</td><td>Examples</td></tr><tr><td>R-X→R+X (neutrals)</td><td>CH4→CH3+H; Fe(CO)5→Fe(CO)4+CO</td></tr><tr><td>R+−X→R++X (cations)</td><td>(H3O)+(H2O)5→(H3O)+(H2O)4+H2O; Fe+(CO)5→Fe+(CO)4+CO</td></tr><tr><td>R−X→R−+X (anions)</td><td>(NO2)−(CO2)5→(NO2)−(CO2)4+CO2; Fe−(CO)4→Fe−(CO)3+CO</td></tr></table>

The BDEs in cations and anions can be derived based on the BDEs in naturals, ionization energy (IE), and electron affinity (EA):

$$
\begin{array}{l} D H ^ {0} (\mathrm {R} ^ {+} - \mathrm {X}) = \Delta_ {\mathrm {f}} H ^ {0} (\mathrm {R} ^ {+}) + \Delta_ {\mathrm {f}} H ^ {0} (\mathrm {X}) - \Delta_ {\mathrm {f}} H ^ {0} (\mathrm {R} ^ {+} \mathrm {X}) \\ = D H ^ {0} (\mathrm {R} - \mathrm {X}) + \mathrm {I E} (\mathrm {R}) - \mathrm {I E} (\mathrm {R X}) \tag {1.3} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} D H ^ {0} (\mathrm {R} ^ {-} - \mathrm {X}) = \Delta_ {\mathrm {f}} H ^ {0} (\mathrm {R} ^ {-}) + \Delta_ {\mathrm {f}} H ^ {0} (\mathrm {X}) - \Delta_ {\mathrm {f}} H ^ {0} (\mathrm {R} ^ {-} \mathrm {X}) \\ = D H ^ {0} (\mathrm {R} - \mathrm {X}) - \mathrm {E A} (\mathrm {R}) + \mathrm {E A} (\mathrm {R X}). \tag {1.4} \\ \end{array}
$$

Currently, heats of formation,  $\Delta_{\mathrm{f}}H^{0}(\mathrm{RX})$ , of more than 7,000 compounds are known. Most of them are available in the following publications: 1996GUR/VEY, 1994FRE/KAB, 1994PED, 1991GUR/VEY, 1989COX/WAG, 1988LIA/BAR, 1986PED/NAY, and two websites (1996NIST, 2003YUN). Additionally, two websites, 2001IUPAC and 2003NASA/JPL, provide critical evaluated data. The experimental uncertainty in compounds' heats of formation is generally within chemical accuracy (i.e.,  $\pm 1$  kcal/mol, 1 calorie  $= 4.184$  J). From Equation 1.2, measurements of BDEs are equivalent to measurements of heats of formation of free radical or ions, and vice versa. Experimental BDEs can be derived directly from Equation 1.2. For example, we may derive the BDE values of  $\mathrm{CH}_3 - \mathrm{X}$ ,  $\mathrm{C}_2\mathrm{H}_5 - \mathrm{X}$ , where  $X = H$ , F, Cl, Br, I, OH, SH,  $\mathrm{NH}_2$ , CN, NO,  $\mathrm{NO}_2$ ,  $\mathrm{CH}_3$ , and  $\mathrm{C}_2\mathrm{H}_5$ , if  $\Delta_{\mathrm{f}}H^{0}(\mathrm{CH}_{3})$  and  $\Delta_{\mathrm{f}}H^{0}(\mathrm{C}_{2}\mathrm{H}_{5})$  are known. From that point, we can derive more data of  $DH^{0}(\mathbb{R}^{+} - X)$  and  $DH^{0}(\mathbb{R}^{-} - X)$  by using Equation 1.3 and Equation 1.4.

The number of confirmed compounds is close to thirty million (2006CAS). We must estimate the heats of formation of compounds and BDEs using ab initio MO theory, density functional theory (DFT), semi-empirical methods (such as PM3 and AM1), molecular mechanics, group additivity, and others. Burcat's e-publication (2001BUR) and

NIST website (2002NIST/COM) provide more information about calculated BDEs, respectively. Although theoretical calculations are interesting and important, calculated BDEs are not included in this book.

# 1.3 Why are reliable BDEs needed?

The earlier experimental BDE data were collected by the previous publications: 1946STE, 1950SZW, 1958COT, 1958SEM, 1962MOR, 1966VED/GUR, 1968GAY, 1970DAR, 1974GUR/KAR, and 1979HUB/HER. Since the 1980s, almost all the BDE data have been updated. For example, the H-C BDE value in benzene increases to  $111.2 \pm 0.8\mathrm{kcal/mol}$  (1994BER/ELL) from 102 (1966VED/GUR) and  $109.3\mathrm{kcal/mol}$  (1974GUR/KAR). The C-C BDE value in ethane increases to  $90.2 \pm 0.2\mathrm{kcal/mol}$  (see Table 4.1) from  $86 \pm 2$  (1966VED/GUR) and  $88.3 \pm 2.0\mathrm{kcal/mol}$  (1974GUR/KAR). The recommended value of the H-OH BDE in water is also updated to  $118.81 \pm 0.07\mathrm{kcal/mol}$  (2002RUS/WAG) from  $119.2 \pm 0.2$  (1970DAR) and  $119.30 \pm 0.05\mathrm{kcal/mol}$  (1994BER/ELL).

The equilibrium constant  $K_{\mathrm{eq}}$  is very sensitive to any error in the BDEs. An error of 1, 2, or 3 kcal leads to an error of a factor of 5.4, 29.2, or 158, respectively, in the equilibrium constant  $K_{\mathrm{eq}}$  at 298 K. The current experimental uncertainty of absolute majority of BDE data is within 1–2 kcal/mol; therefore, the uncertainty is greater than chemical accuracy (±1 kcal/mol). Experimental BDE values will continue to be a source of lively controversy among scientists now and in the foreseeable future. The current experimental uncertainty for H–H, H–D, and D–D BDEs is ±0.0001 kcal/mol (see 2004ZHA/CHE, or Table 11.1 in chapter 11).

$$
\begin{array}{l} D H ^ {0} (\mathrm {H - H}) = 1 0 4. 1 5 3 9 \pm 0. 0 0 0 1 \mathrm {k c a l / m o l} \text {o r} 4 3 5. 7 7 9 9 \pm 0. 0 0 0 1 \mathrm {k J / m o l} \\ D H ^ {0} (\mathrm {H - D}) = 1 0 4. 9 7 6 7 \pm 0. 0 0 0 1 \mathrm {k c a l / m o l} \text {o r} 4 3 9. 2 2 2 3 \pm 0. 0 0 0 2 \mathrm {k J / m o l} \\ D H ^ {0} (\mathrm {D - D}) = 1 0 5. 9 5 6 0 \pm 0. 0 0 0 1 \mathrm {k c a l / m o l} \text {o r} 4 4 3. 3 1 9 7 \pm 0. 0 0 0 3 \mathrm {k J / m o l} \\ \end{array}
$$

Several senior reviewers have made efforts to update known BDEs rapidly, such as 1966KER, 1969GOL/BEN, 1970ONE/BEN, 1978BEN, 1982MCM/GOL, 1986KEE/CAS, 1988COL, 1990SIM/BEA, 1994BER/ELL, 1994NOL, 1996CER, 1996FRE, 1996TSA, 1999COH, 2003BLA/ELL, and 2003OPE/RAB. However, the number of experimental BDEs is increasing sharply. We now have collected experimental data on over 19,600 bonds of 102 elements. A new publication that completely compiles all available BDEs will be of benefit to chemists, biochemists, and chemical engineers.

# 1.4 Scope of this book

The experimental BDEs of many important compounds have been measured many times. A typical example is C-H BDE in methane. It has been reported as many as fifty times since the 1930s, and the value spans from an early  $98\mathrm{kcal / mol}$  to the current  $105.0\pm 0.1\mathrm{kcal / mol}$ . Although we have collected experimental data, it is not necessary to include all of the data in this book because most users are concerned with reliable experimental values only.

This book will present recent experimental data for the given bonds, up to a maximum of five values for each bond. It is hard to state definitively the most reliable data for the BDEs. Recent measurements tend to be more generally reliable. Readers may search more experimental data using the references listed.

The BDEs have been tabulated based on the center atom in the radicals, ions, clusters and complexes. This volume collects the experimental BDEs in all varied reactants. The scope is shown as:

The enthalpy change of the following processes is beyond the scope of this book. The readers may use relative databases for searching these data. In fact, the enthalpy change for these processes is related to the BDE:

This book is divided four sections:

1. Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 are the Introductions. Chapter 3 through Chapter 28 are the main body of this book.  
2. Chapter 3 through Chapter 10 present C-, O-, N-, S-, Si-, Ge-, Sn-, Pb-, P-, As-, Sb-, Bi-, Se-, and Te-X BDEs in the molecules and radicals.  
3. Chapter 11 through Chapter 24 deliver experimental BDEs in inorganics, organometallics, ions, clusters, supramolecules, hydrogen- and surface-bonded species, van der Waals complexes, and isotopic species.

The BDEs in C-, Si-, Sn-, Pb-, N-, P-, As-, Sb-, Bi-, O, S-, Se-, Te-, and halogen-clusters or complexes are presented in Chapter 25 through Chapter 28, respectively. The arrangements of BDE data in these neutral, cations, anions, clusters, and complexes are shown in the following Periodic Table. Here the numbers represent chapters of the BDE data for these bonds.

4. Chapter 29 summarizes the heats of formation of atoms, inorganic and organic radicals, and monoatomic cations or anions in the gas-phase.

# 1.5 On energy units

The SI unit of energy is joule (1 calorie = 4.184 joules). There are three options for energy units: joule only, calories only, and both units. Using both units is a better choice.

Why? There are three reasons: (1) most heats of formation of radicals, ions and BDEs used to be measured in kcal/mol, and (2) the range of the BDE values for common organic species is from about 20 (as  $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}, \mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}-\mathrm{NH}_{3}, (\mathrm{HO}_{4}\mathrm{S})^{-}-\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}, \mathrm{NO}_{2}^{-}-\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ ) to 110 (as  $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5}, \mathrm{H}-\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3}$ ) kcal/mol. As you know, a lower number is easy to remember in our everyday life, it is also the same in science. For example, we may easily remember  $105.0 \mathrm{kcal/mol}$  of  $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$  BDE rather than  $439.3 \mathrm{kJ/mol}$ . (3) Most users prefer both units.

Traditional energy units (e.g.,  $\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ , eV, au, K, kcal/mol) are still used in many publications for measurements and calculations of BDEs. Therefore, the energy conversion between non-SI (traditional) and SI units frequently needs to be made. The table of the energy conversion is shown in Table 1.1.

# 1.6 How to search for BDEs in this book

In creating this handbook, the authors encountered a large number of experimental BDEs from several thousand publications. The data are like goods in a large department store; they should be organized in different locations for research's purposes. In this book,

these data are managed in various categories. The chemical bonds with most similar structural environments are assembled in tables. There are 225 separated tables for BDE data in this book. All tabulated values of the BDEs are systematized by the following eight orders:

1. Bond class such as C-H, C-C, C-O, C-N, C-S, C-F, C-Cl, C-Br, C-I, and so on.  
2. Heteroatom(s) and functional group(s) at  $\alpha$ -position (relative to the broken bond) such as O, CO, C(O)O, N, CN, NO,  $\mathrm{NO}_2$ , NN, S, SO,  $\mathrm{SO}_2$ , and more. The heteroatom(s) and function group(s) have significant influence on the BDEs. Organic chemistry is usually organized by the concept of functional groups. Therefore, users must first figure out heteroatom(s) and functional group(s) before searching the data. For example,  
- The primary C-H BDE in  $\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2 - H}$  is listed in Table 3.4. In this book, the boldface emphasizes the dissociated atom or group.  
- The secondary C-H BDE in  $\mathrm{PhCH}_2\mathrm{COCH}_3$  is listed in Table 3.6.1. There is a CO group at the  $\alpha$ -position of the C-H bond.  
- The secondary C-H BDE in  $\mathrm{PhCOCH}_2\mathrm{NMe}_2$  is listed in Table 3.6.3. There are a CO group and an N atom at the  $\alpha$ -position of the C-H bond.  
- The secondary C-H BDE in  $\mathrm{PhCOCH}_2\mathrm{SO}_2\mathrm{Ph}$  is listed in Table 3.6.4. There are a CO group and a  $\mathrm{SO}_2$  group at the  $\alpha$ -position of the C-H bond.

3. Bond order (triple, double, and single) and the bond degree (primary, secondary, or tertiary). The compounds with triple bond and primary BDEs are listed first.

4. Saturated or unsaturated compounds. Saturated ones are listed first.

5. Molecular size. The BDEs of smaller molecules are arranged first.

6. Molecular shape (chain or cyclic). The BDEs of chain molecules are arranged first.

7. While substituent(s)-containing, please first search the bonds in the parent molecules. For example, the C-H BDEs in substituted toluene are listed under  $\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2 - H}$ .

8. The BDEs in free radicals, ions, clusters, and complexes are collected in this volume. The listed order is as follows: the BDEs in neutrals (including free radicals), the BDEs in cations, and the BDEs in anions. For example,  $\mathrm{Fe(CO)_x - CO}$  bonds are first;  $\mathrm{Fe(CO)_x^+ - CO}$ , second; then  $\mathrm{Fe(CO)_x^- - CO}$  bond.  $\mathrm{NH_3 - NH_3}$  bond is first;  $(\mathrm{NH}_3)\mathrm{H}^+ (\mathrm{NH}_3)_x\mathrm{-NH}_3$  bonds, second; then  $(\mathrm{NH}_2)^-(\mathrm{NH}_3)_x\mathrm{-NH}_3$  bonds.  $\mathrm{C}^{+}(\mathrm{C})_{\mathrm{x}}\mathrm{-C}$  bonds are first, then  $\mathrm{C}^{-}(\mathrm{C})_{\mathrm{x}}\mathrm{-C}$  bonds, there  $x = 0,1,2,3,$  etc.

The book's contents and the two indexes (species classes and compound names) may provide a method for quicker searching.

# 1.7 How to use the BDE data tables

All BDE data are filed into 225 separated tables. The C-H BDE in methane provides an example of how to find the BDEs.

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">The broken bonds (boldface=dissociated atom) ΔfH0(R), kcal/mol (kJ/mol)</td><td colspan="2">BDEs (boldface= recommended data; references in parentheses)</td><td rowspan="2">Methods (references in parentheses)</td><td rowspan="2">References</td></tr><tr><td>kcal/mol</td><td>kJ/mol</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Methane</td><td>(1) 105.0±0.1</td><td>439.3±0.4</td><td>(1) VLPP</td><td>(1) 1987DOB/BEN</td></tr><tr><td>(2) 105.3±0.7</td><td>440.6±2.9</td><td>(2) PIMS detection</td><td>(2) 1988RUS/SEE(b)</td></tr><tr><td>CH3-H</td><td>(3) 104.8±0.2</td><td>438.5±0.8</td><td>(3) Spectrometric detection</td><td>(3) 1990SEE/RUS</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">ΔfH0(R)=35.06±0.1 (146.7±0.3)</td><td>(4) 105.3±0.6</td><td>440.6±2.5</td><td>(4) Resonance fluorescence detection</td><td>(4) 1991NIC/DIJ</td></tr><tr><td>(5) 104.99±0.03</td><td>439.28±0.13</td><td>(5) AE, revised</td><td>(5) 1999RUS/LIT</td></tr></table>

The first column in this table shows the broken bonds. The boldface emphasizes the dissociated atom or group; here, the H is boldfaced. For example,  $\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{CH}_2$ .  $\mathrm{CH}_2\mathrm{CH}_3$  shows a secondary C-H bond in  $n$ -butane is broken;  $(\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{CH}_2)_3\mathrm{N}$  shows a secondary C-H bond in triethylamine is broken. All expressions are similar. The heat of formation of free radicals is shown in this cell. Chapter 29 includes tables of all  $\Delta_{\mathrm{f}}H^{0}(\mathrm{R})$ .

The second column shows the experimental values of BDEs for the given bond. The numbers (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) show five different resources or references. The recommended value is emphasized by boldface.

The third column shows various experimental methods for the relevant BDE value. For an explanation of terms, see the Notations and Abbreviations list in this book.

The fourth column shows the references for the given experimental methods and for the relevant BDE value. A maximum of five values are provided. This is sufficient for most users. Readers can search for more references while using the references here.

The following provide three more examples:

1. The C-O BDE in methoxybenzen or anisole. The experimental data of BDE(C-O) are from four different methods. The first three values are contributed from independent measurements of different research groups. The last one is derived by Equation 1.2 where heats of formation of the parent molecules are taken from the given reference, and heats of formation of atoms and radicals are taken from Chapter 29.  
2. The weakest H-O BDEs in four tocopherols (vitamin E). They emphasize the differences between experimental H-O BDEs in gas phase and liquid phase.  
3. The H-N BDEs in substituted diphenylamine. They show the effects of various remote substitutes Y on the H-N BDEs.

Similar arrangements are also for the BDEs in radicals, ions, and clusters from Chapter 11 through Chapter 28. Three examples are provided below:

1. The H-bond energies in water clusters. They are dimer, trimer, tetramer, pentamer, hexamer, heptamer, and octamer if  $x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$ , respectively. These show the H-bond energies significantly depend on the size of the clusters.  
2. The  $\mathrm{Fe}^{+}-\mathrm{C}$  BDEs. Here L is the ligand and represents varied C-centered radicals, e.g., C, CH,  $\mathrm{CH}_{2}, \mathrm{CH}_{3}$ , and  $\mathrm{CF}_{2}$ . The  $\mathrm{Fe}^{+}-\mathrm{C}$  BDEs vary with the ligands.  
3. The Co-C BDE in vitamin  $\mathbf{B}_{12}$  family. The table presents five experimental values.  
4. The BDEs of van der Waals complexes  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  (ice, surface)-X in the atmosphere; there X represents CO, HCl,  $\mathrm{O}_3$ , or  $\mathrm{CH}_4$ .

# Experimental methods for measuring BDEs

# 2.1 A summary of main experimental methods

The object of most end-users is to find reliable data. However, it is very helpful if the users know experimental BDE data's sources.

A very concise description of experimental methods is summarized in Table 2.1. It provides main methods, measured quantities, applications, and references. This description should aid the reader's interpretation of the BDE data tables found throughout this handbook.

# 2.2 The conversion between  $D_{0}, D_{\mathrm{e}},$  and  $DH^{0}$

Related energies are often encountered when searching for experimental BDE data.

$D_0$  the bond dissociation energy at  $0\mathrm{K}$  
$D_{\mathrm{e}}$  the electronic energy, i.e., the minimum on the potential energy curve or surface or the well depth.

$D_0(\mathbb{R} - X)$  may be determined from  $D_{\mathrm{e}}$  as shown in figure:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-03/1b51229e-cfc1-4141-b07c-980d9e7e6a7d/e54ef451330447dd8d843b0c63ecd6c4adbdcabb6e0687f4900ed06eb4acf81d.jpg)

$$
D _ {0} = D _ {\mathrm {e}} - \Delta (\mathrm {Z P E}) \tag {2.1}
$$

Here  $\Delta (\mathrm{ZPE})$  is the change of the zero point vibrational energies in the species involved in the bond dissociation processes, the dissociating state as the energy reference.

For diatomic molecules and Morse potential, the approximate relationship follows:

$$
D _ {0} \simeq \frac {\omega_ {\mathrm {e}} ^ {2}}{4 \omega_ {\mathrm {e}} x _ {\mathrm {e}}} - \frac {\omega_ {\mathrm {e}}}{2} + \frac {\omega_ {\mathrm {e}} x _ {\mathrm {e}}}{4}
$$

$$
D _ {\mathrm {e}} \simeq \frac {\omega_ {\mathrm {e}} ^ {2}}{4 \omega_ {\mathrm {e}} x _ {\mathrm {e}}} \tag {2.2}
$$

$$
\Delta (\mathrm {Z P E}) = \frac {\omega_ {\mathrm {e}}}{2} - \frac {\omega_ {\mathrm {e}} x _ {\mathrm {e}}}{4}
$$

Here  $\omega_{\mathrm{e}}$  and  $x_{\mathrm{e}}$  are the spectroscopic parameters.

In general, the relationship between the dissociation enthalpy change and temperature must be determined to make the conversion from  $D_0$  to  $DH^0$ . There are four methods for this conversion.

1. Thermochemical calculations (2005RUS/BOG).  
2. Calculations by quantum chemistry (1997CUR/RAG; 2000CIO/SCH; 2002NIST/COM).  
3. Using NIST-JANAF Thermochemical Tables (1998CHA).  
4. Simple approximation. This is good for biatomic, triatomic, and tetraatomic species. This method is reviewed below.

# 2.2.1 Diatomic molecules

From thermodynamics, the enthalpy change,  $\Delta H$ , and internal energy change,  $\Delta E$ , for the bond dissociation processes is described as

$$
\Delta H = \Delta E + \Delta (P V) \tag {2.3}
$$

Where  $\Delta (PV)$  is the molar work that is equal to  $\Delta (RT)$ , assuming 1 molar ideal gas. For diatomic species, a vibrational free degree becomes a translational one because of the bond dissociation. An approximate equation is obtained as

$$
\Delta H = \Delta E + R T \approx D _ {0} + \frac {3}{2} R T \tag {2.4}
$$

For  $T = 298.15 \, \mathrm{K}$ , the BDE is derived based on the experimental  $D_0$  at  $0 \, \mathrm{K}$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {B D E} \equiv D H ^ {0} \approx D _ {0} + \frac {3}{2} R T \tag {2.5} \\ = D _ {0} + 0. 8 8 8 6 \mathrm {k c a l / m o l} = D _ {0} + 3. 7 1 8 1 \mathrm {k J / m o l} \\ \end{array}
$$

Here the  $R$  is the gas constant; the  $H$  in the nomenclature  $DH^0$  emphasizes that the BDE is the enthalpy change of the dissociation processes. The superscript '0' denotes the standard conditions of thermodynamics.

# 2.2.2 Polyatomic molecules

For the bond dissociation process of polyatomic molecules at the standard conditions of thermodynamics

$$
\mathrm {R} - \mathrm {X} \rightarrow \mathrm {R} + \mathrm {X}
$$

The formation heat for each species at  $T = 298.15$ , K is estimated

$$
\Delta_ {\mathrm {f}} H ^ {0} = E _ {0} + \mathrm {Z P E} + \left(E _ {\text {t r a n s}} + E _ {\text {r o t}} + E _ {\text {v i b}}\right) + R T \tag {2.6}
$$

where  $E_0$  is the internal energy,  $E_{\mathrm{trans}}$ ,  $E_{\mathrm{rot}}$ , and  $E_{\mathrm{vib}}$  are the translational, rotational, and vibrational contribution to the enthalpy, respectively. According to the definition of the BDE

$$
\begin{array}{l} D H ^ {0} = \Delta_ {\mathrm {f}} H ^ {0} (\mathrm {R}) + \Delta_ {\mathrm {f}} H ^ {0} (\mathrm {X}) - \Delta_ {\mathrm {f}} H ^ {0} (\mathrm {R X}) \tag {2.7} \\ = D _ {\mathrm {e}} - \Delta (\mathrm {Z P E}) + \Delta E _ {\mathrm {t h}} + R T \\ \end{array}
$$

or

where

$$
D H ^ {0} = D _ {0} + \Delta E _ {\mathrm {t h}} + R T \tag {2.8}
$$

$$
D _ {\mathrm {e}} = \Delta E _ {0} = E _ {0} (\mathrm {R}) + E _ {0} (\mathrm {X}) - E _ {0} (\mathrm {R X}) \tag {2.9}
$$

$$
\Delta (\mathrm {Z P E}) = \mathrm {Z P E} (\mathrm {R}) + \mathrm {Z P E} (\mathrm {X}) - \mathrm {Z P E} (\mathrm {R X}) \tag {2.10}
$$

$\Delta E_0$  represents the internal energy change of the dissociation reactions.  $\Delta E_{\mathrm{th}}$  is the change associated with the translational, rotational, and vibrational energy in going from  $T = 0$  to  $298.15\mathrm{K}$ . The following is this general result:

$$
\Delta E _ {\mathrm {t h}} \geq \frac {N}{2} R T \tag {2.11}
$$

Here  $N$  is the increasing number of translation and rotational degrees of freedom because of the dissociation reactions.  $N = 1$  for diatomic species;  $N = 2$  for non-linear triatomic ones (as H-OH); and  $N = 3$  for non-linear tetraatomic ones (as  $\mathrm{H - NH_2}$ ). Therefore, there is a simple relationship

$$
D H ^ {0} \leq D _ {0} + \left(\frac {N}{2} + 1\right) R T \tag {2.12}
$$

For diatomic molecules, the  $\Delta (\mathrm{ZPE})$  and  $\Delta E_{\mathrm{th}}$  become the simplest and are given by

$$
\Delta (\mathrm {Z P E}) \approx \frac {1}{2} \omega_ {\mathrm {e}} = \frac {1}{2} h v \tag {2.13}
$$

$$
\Delta E _ {\mathrm {t h}} = \left(\frac {3}{2} R T + \frac {3}{2} R T\right) - \left(\frac {3}{2} R T + R T\right) = \frac {1}{2} R T \tag {2.14}
$$

Here  $h$  is the Plank constant, and  $\nu$  is the vibrational frequency. Finally, Equation 2.5 is reproduced.
